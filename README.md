50 States Quiz

This is a simple quiz I made as apersonal project. The motivation was to learn geography while learning to code!

The player types in as many States as they can remember into the Input Field. The States that they have remembered will turn green on the map. By clicking "Give Up" the player can end the round and see the States that they couldn't remember.
